I am a Web Developer, Fashion stylist and an artist. Passionate about graphic design, architecture, animation and the in general the Art world. My goal in life is to be able to apply the skills I have learn along my professional journey. I desire to inspire and be inspired by others and enjoy the beauty of the creatives industries.

My career path in the fashion industry officially started back in 2006, but it was not until 2008 that I attended the Istituto Marangoni (Milan, Italy) and got a degree in Fashion Styling. I have had the opportunity to work with some of the world's top photography agency and fashion brands such as Elite Models, Art Partner, Diane Von FÃ¼rstenberg and Muzungu Sisters in Paris. The experience that I have acquired has led me to engage even more in the creative industries.
