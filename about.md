### About
I am a fashion stylist / graphic designer and an artist. Passionate about design, and the art world. 

My career path in the fashion industry officially started back in 2006, but it was not until 2008 that I attended the Istituto Marangoni (Milan, Italy) and got a degree in Fashion Styling. I have had the opportunity to work with some of the world's top photography agency and fashion brands such as Elite Models, Art Partner, Diane Von FÃ¼rstenberg and Muzungu Sisters in Paris. The experience that I have acquired has led me to engage even more in this industry due to the challenges I had to face and the creativity it requires to be successful in this international market.
