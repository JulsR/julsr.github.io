I am a multilingual tourist from the Dominican Republic. Passionate about art, languages, travel and meeting new people along with their cultures. Graduated from Fashion Styling in Milan, Italy back in 2011, since then I have had the opportunity to work with some of the top brands in the Fashion Industry. Now pursuing my BFA in Web/Interactive Media, I desire to apply the skills I have learn along my professional journey. My goal is to inspire and be inspired by others while enjoying the beauty of the creatives industries.
