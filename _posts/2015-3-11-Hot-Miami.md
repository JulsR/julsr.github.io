Miamians are really, really hot, and everyone knows it-including Miamians, it turns out.

CNBC.com listed Miami as the third most stressfull city in America, but ironicallu is also consider to be the No.1
best looking city in America. As they say "Dress to Impress", those is statement has created a city in which everyone stress
out because constantly thinking in their appearance?

The majority of Miami locals gave themselves a 7 or higher on a scale of 1 to 10 for attractiveness. The standard beauty has change over the past years, creating a psychological pressure on the residents of Miami. Now we have more and more surgery procedures such as laser hair removal, collagen injections, and liposuction than anywhere else. Both NYC and LA are cities also known because of their stress levels for self-absoption, but when you think about Miami this city is design for vanity-anxiety.

Surrounded with mirrors and shiny buildings, expensive cars, fabulous maison, numerous of marinas, walkable boulevards and their high-end fashion stores, perfect bodies, tight clothing and perfectly bronzed skin as if they all have being photoshop. Miami over the years has encourage the big ego of the pretty and populars. Creating a mentality of showing off without any concerns of having invariably feelings of inadequacy and inevitable stress.
