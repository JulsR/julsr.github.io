Understanding the target market and their intent has saved and earned millions to a company in exposure. The concept of "newsjacking" is consider relatively simple and straightforward.. Propably one of the best marketing strategies that a brand could used with the purpose of driving traffic and creating exposure. The idea is to piggyback off the dayâ€™s biggest news stories to draw attention to their own content. Marketers have a unique opportunity to ride the popularity wave of a breaking story to benefit their business in some way, however newsjacking certainly has its risks. If newsjacking is used in an insensitive way like Kenneth Cole in this tweets, this may cause serious damage to the brand.

Newsjacking consists of the following components:

1. Being aware of breaking news:
Set up Google Alerts, read a lot of news, and actively follow social media.

2. Having a keyword strategy: You need to know what keywords people are searching for and make sure they are placed correctly into your content. The purpose is to create an angle that focuses on exact phrases from the original news content and use them both in your headline and content. 

3. Quick syndication of content: In newsjacking, timing is everything. Once your content is ready and the news has come out, you really need to pounce. Newsjacking is most effective when you are the first to act.
