R.J. Shipley once said "If each and every one of us were more lazy . . . society would benefit".

Shocking statement, right?? Personally I believe humans are very lazy, eventhough the human body is design to stay in motion it
doesn't take much effort to lay down and do nothing. The word "lazy" means unwilling to work or use energy, an unmotivated factor. But the word is mainly used when a person has decided to abandon their obligations. We say that those whom lack motivation will never achieve their dreams or take advantage of their potential. They are the ones who make time for television, videogames, social media and friends, but not for school. They manage poorly activities like working hard on school, at their jobs or even in their personal relationships.


The cure for laziness has yet to be discovered. Still, we have learned a few helpful things from research on motivation. First, not all human brains mature at the same rate (girls are reliably ahead of boys), so there is hope for what may just be a late bloomer. Second, motivation is closely linked to the autonomy of each person. Those lucky enough to set their own course are more invested in the outcome. Somewhere, however, the autonomy has come to mean the freedom to do whatever you want.
