Miami has being making some noise on the tech industry. Even though the city is on its early stages
of becoming a tech hub, there is already a tech community with a heartbeat. The tech scene was establish
by creative campuses for entrepreneurs and innovators like The Lab, Venture Hive and the Miami Entrepreneurship 
Center. These organizations have built a welcoming community base for those interested on educational content that
focus on the technological and entrepreneurial opportunities. Organizations like Refresh Miami which is affiliated
with The Lab, host regular meetups and events to provide the community accessible educational content. The mission is 
to reach to tech- developers, designers and aspirants of South Florida.



Coming soon on Saturday March 28th, 2015 is BarCamp Miami X. The event will be hosted at The Miami Ad School in 
Wynwood Art District. An event intended for the tech community to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of BarCamp. 
BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment.
Everyone from new startups, entrepreneurs, college students, tech masters and brilliant minds are attending 
the event to learn and network with others of their field. It is a free event with discussions and interaction 
that brings people together who understand what new technology means for Miamiâ€™s future.
