title: No Rush. You’ll master PHP in no Time.
---

Although PHP seems like a very intimidating programming language to learn is a must for developers whom are interested in 
refining their server-side applications.PHP is a server-side scripting language primarily used 
to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, but is design as a general-purpose programming language.

Those that are already exposed to some programming language and have a foundation on HTML,CSS and even a little of Javascript
or JQuery may easily master the basics of the language. By reading a couple of books along won’t help you master the language. 
You must submerge yourself at least daily and be familiar some key concepts like; MySQL, XAMP, MAMP, Apache and web frameworks 
used to create your PHP projects.If you searched on the web, is recommended to have at least 10,000 of hours to master the
language. Don’t worry even I was really shock with this fact, but the point here is that “practice makes perfection”.

Nowadays we can visit multiple interactive online platforms that will teach us the language for free. This platforms have 
unlimited online courses for each user to start training at their own pace.Online learning has become more and more popular
