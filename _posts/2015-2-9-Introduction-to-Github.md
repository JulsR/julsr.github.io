title: Introduction to Github
---

Learning to used Github is very useful on the web industry not only for developers
but also for those who need a repository to host their code. Github is a web-based Git 
repository hosting service  that offers source management control and distributed version 
control functionality of Git. Honestly so far I am not a big fan of the service, maybe because
I still haven't understand the capacity of Github. For some beginner users the concept may be
very un-clear. Eventhough if you visit their website Github.com they have a very clean  self-explanatory 
design for new users to start using the service. Many things can be done like; creating a repository, 
sending pull request, following other users and even forking an existing project. We have decided to start
using Github and fork Jekyll for our personal blog, which is hosted by Github. Jekyll will transform your
simple text into a static webpage that comes ready with HTML & CSS template to be manipulated. It is also a
great way to host your blog. Jekyll has existing categories, pages and customs layout upon which your content
just need to be inserted. So far we have created our blog and added some post as well as other tools 
like; the social media and mailing list to inform our viewers of the latest updates.
