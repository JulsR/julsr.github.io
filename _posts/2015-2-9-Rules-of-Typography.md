---

A web developer needs to understand the rules of graphic design and typography. 
Since typography is the most common element on any website, it is very helpful to provide
an easy readable content for an effective communication with the users. Web designers should 
be aware of the basic rules of design. Layouts, columns width, line height and type size play
an important role once building a creative website. The goal is to gain the visitors trust and 
attention, after all we desired they read the content and browse through the website.

Rules of typography:

1. Emphasis -

 Is the exaggeration of words in a text with a font in a different style

DO keep it simple.

Make it big or very small and surrounded it with a lot of white space.

Position it in the optical center of the page.

Use entirely different typefaces to achieve the effect.

DO NOT use more than one maybe two font styles and variants.



2. Contrast -

Typographic contrast is a deft and powerful weapon in your design arsenal.

DO pair your fonts with thought.

 There are typefaces meant for titles, and typefaces meant for body. 


DON'T mix them up! 

Typically, the way to go for the title is a bolder typeface, generally a sans-serif, but sometimes a decorative one. 
For the body — serifed fonts are created to look and read better in large bodies of text.

01 Do set up an interesting typographic rhythm. 
02 Contrast the weight of the face as well as the style. 
03 Placing small elements next to large elements. 
04 Warm colors with cool colors.
05 Place two radically different fonts next to each other, adds an unexpected element.


3. Balance - 

An arrangement of one or more elements in the design, maintaining an equilibrium.

DO informal balance it creates a visual interest.

One of the major advantages of an asymmetrical layout is that it allows for the more 
dynamic use of white space. This is particularly important if illustrations are included.

DON'T forget proportions. Decide which elements need to be emphasized. 


4. Hierarchy -

A  system for organizing type that establishes an order of importance. 

DO  BLOW OUT!

One character up so large that it bleeds off the page edges and then place the rest of the text in a much smaller size.



DON'T Keep The Text Small

It becomes very difficult for everyone to read when the body text is small. Always keep your default
text size large so that, readers can easily see what’s written. Some people recommend the text size of 14-16 pt.
