Rumors are that society today is being sexually bombarded. From the earliest years the message is ‘SEX SELLS’. 
This sexual message is being promoted in advertising and all kinds of media. We are talking about a sex without 
the leavening of love or affection. No attachments, just feelings of desire and lust to the mundane. A desire to 
be loved is one of the strongest emotions and in this modern society the meaning is being projected as a powerful 
force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotions.

Sex sells, it’s a great attention grabber, associating a product of desire or a basic human need to a source that 
creates a lasting visual effect. The idea is to fabricate an illusion of our deepest dreams, a misinterpretation of a
true sensation. Those erotic fantasy that no human dare themselves to admit out loud. Thoughts that are not socially 
acceptable; sexual satisfaction, sex appeal and constant interest in the human body. Beauty, attraction, perfection, 
sensational and nudity are additions that are seen to be ￼neither nutritious nor substantial, but provides a potentiall
y addictive appeal which will sustain the attention of a wider audience. IF IT’S PROHIBITED IS MORE APPEALING.

“I felt as nervous and shy as any schoolboy” - And his letters grew colder
For everything in the world, the cravings of sinful man, the lust of the eyes and the boasting of what he has 
and does, comes not of the Father but from the world.
1 John 2 16:16

Our mission is to look for love and affection. To feel appreciate, wanted, to be someones possession. 
Humans are interested in fulfilling their void. There’s no lie that we not made of iron, but of flesh and blood. 
Making us a weak species that gives into the cravings of the forbidden fruit. Forgetting about control and looking 
for the 5 minutes pleasure, a fake heaven. Holding on to things that makes us believe that is worth while, that there
is more to look forward in life. Seducing our mind to a misleading direction. A reason why the market wouldn’t still 
be doing sexual exploitation it if it didn’t overall work.

“ You’re driving me insane” ... Like a dummy with senses
“ When you laugh like that I want to strangle you, and then I want to love you.” “ I’m so happy and so miserable.”
- And his letters grew colder

WE ARE UNDER ATTACK! This sexual theme is damaging our mentality ever since it became accepted as a conventional 
means of entertainment. Their is evidence that our society is being more expose to sexual messages than the earliest years.
The ideology ￼today is that we should “lust from everything in sight” is an acceptable normal human behavior. Promoting
a relentless and casual basis for those brands to profit the idea.

Sexualized imagery is now a mainstream part of the society daily activities. We are being bombarded by the advertising
from radio, magazines, billboards and the Internet. Also our emails are flooded with catalogs, flyers or spam that contains
ads with this sexualized explicit content. Even for the asexual people is difficult to resist the pressure because if being 
display everywhere from public places or in the home through television and other media. The message is becoming more assessable
to all type of people especially the young target. They seem to be genuinely more interested in sex, as if their curiosity 
about sex has been ratcheted up some notches.

It has created an obsession on their looks and on the way they are desirable by others. Instead of taking pleasure in 
their talents, abilities or essential qualities as decent human beings. They are becoming an object, a stereotype or an
asset to society and this contemporary idea. Living up to the expectations. Handling the pressure.

The question is; but why resist to the sexual urges and the physical appetite? Isn’t it more interesting! 
Shouldn’t we all follow what the society offers, they said it is the healthiest way.
The motto is to “ Please yourself today and forget about the tomorrow’s regrets.”
WHY ALL THIS COMMOTION ABOUT SEX? Isn’t satisfaction supposed to be fun and a stress reliever.
Supposedly the pressure of modern society is taking a toll on sexual satisfaction. Sexual people may or may
not know how much sex there is in television and how often the promise of sex is used to attract. Society is 
placing a not so subtle pressure on people to be sexual and to act on those stimuli.

Encouraging on humans feelings of inadequacy, vanity anxiety and regardless of the quantity of pleasure 
and possession a true lack of love and happiness. Became our 5 minutes of fake heaven not worth while when tomorrow comes.
So my advice is to “Live your own value system and blow off the rest.” Desire to the love and be loved.
