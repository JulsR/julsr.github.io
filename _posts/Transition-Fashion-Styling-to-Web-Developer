title: Transition: Fashion to Web Design!
---

People always ask me, how come did you decided to study Web Design since is so different from Fashion?

Fashion Styling is my first career, about 6 years ago I decided to move to Milan, Italy and pursue fashion.
At the time the decision was a little bit spontaneous but it turns out to be the right career choice. 
Learning about fashion is not as shallow as the masses think, fashion in general, is a complete study of human
behaviors and custom through style. Going back to the beginning of history from Adam and Eve to today's generations, 
humans used fashion as a need of distinguishing a personal style. Overall, the study requires an amount of research and 
study to psychology, sociology, marketing and art history to comprehend what relies behind the perception of an individual
toward a piece of clothing. It is both very interesting and we may say complex at the same time. As I see it they are both 
in the liberal arts education and are considered to be the hottest studies of the modern world. Web design in the other hand 
is the collection of different skills and disciplines united to create a product, in other words same concept. In the end I
consider them both a passion, either you love it or you hate it.
